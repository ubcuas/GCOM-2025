## Running the Server
**If you are on Windows, you will need to run this whole project in WSL**
1. Start Redis Server (if not already running): `redis-server`
2. Start GCOM: `poetry run python server.py` (in `/src`)
3. Start Celery Worker: `poetry run python -m celery -A gcom worker` (in `/src`)

## Major Dependencies 
### Overview
- Uvicorn: ASGI Server
- Django + DRF: For ORM and API
- SocketIO: For WebSocket support
- Celery: for multithreading
- Redis: Message Broker (you will need to install this seperately)

### Poetry
This project uses `poetry`. To install poetry, follow the guide on the 
website. Then run: `poetry install` to install required dependencies. 
Some relavent commands you may want to know:
- `poetry shell` - Spawns and activates the poetry venv. Run `exit` to 
exit the venv
- `poetry add <module>` - Add a dependency
- `poetry remove <module>` - Remove a dependency
- `poetry run <command>` - Run a command in the poetry venv without 
activating it

### Swagger
Documentation is automatically generated by `drf-spectacular` to the
OpenAPIv3 standard. Sometimes, you may wish your endpoints be displayed 
a bit differently and you can use the `@extend_schema` decorator to 
further control how your endpoint is displayed.
